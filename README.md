# Femicide in Kenya — A Data & AI-Powered Analysis (2016–2025)

Welcome to the **Femicide in Kenya** End-to-End Analysis Project. This project combines **data storytelling**, **web scraping**, and **conversational AI** to document, track, and explain the femicide crisis in Kenya. As a data analyst and AI practitioner, I built tools to answer complex societal questions, raise awareness, and present facts in a structured, publicly accessible way.

## Project Objectives

The primary goals of this project were to:

- Scrape and collect **femicide data** in Kenya from 2016 to 2025 using online news and reports.
- Identify **patterns**, **triggers**, and **hotspot regions** for femicide cases.
- Visualize femicide trends, media coverage, and judicial delays.
- Deploy a **conversational AI agent** to answer questions about femicide in real-time.
- Provide a **daily updated femicide tracker** on a custom-built website.

## Project Overview

Femicide — the gender-based killing of women — has become a critical crisis in Kenya, yet it lacks centralized and publicly accessible data. This project provides a multi-pronged approach:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Cleaning and transforming over 900+ reported femicide cases from 2016–2025.
- **Media Analysis:** Scraping and analyzing data from media outlets to evaluate coverage trends.
- **Conversational Agent:** Built with Vertex AI Agent Builder to allow users to ask questions like "Which counties have the highest femicide rates?" or "How many women were killed in 2023?"
- **Automation:** Auto-updating pipeline fetches new femicide stories daily and updates the website.

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate entries from scraped news sources.
- Standardized victim information (age, county, date, relationship to perpetrator).
- Filled missing data based on contextual clues from articles.

### Key Metrics Explored:
- Yearly femicide counts (2016–2025).
- County-wise distribution of femicide.
- Relationship of victim to perpetrator.
- Media coverage vs. actual reported deaths.
- Delay in judicial processes per case.

---

## 2. Key Questions Answered

- **Which year recorded the highest femicide deaths in Kenya?**
- **Which counties are the most affected?**
- **What is the most common perpetrator relationship?**
- **What role does the media play in covering these cases?**
- **How long does it take to reach verdicts in femicide cases?**
- **How can we use AI to create early warning systems or alerts?**

---

## Dashboards

Dashboards were developed using **Plotly**, **Matplotlib**, and **Recharts** (in the website version):

- Yearly Femicide Trends
- County Distribution of Victims
- Relationship of Victims to Offenders
- Verdict Delay per Case
- Media Source Coverage and Bias
- Victim Age & Location Patterns
